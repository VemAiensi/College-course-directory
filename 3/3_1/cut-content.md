Apart from all these, I had trouble in my love aspect as well. No, maybe it isn’t love yet but just a mere affection. I had this person which I really have a crush on. We both know each other and she even confessed her feelings already before. But, I chose not to take action in order to obey our family rules. I fought all the urge of asking her to a date, kept every feeling I had to myself believing that the time I graduated, have a decent livelihood, will be the right time. However, I didn’t expect that I did these endurances and sacrifices only to for my inspiration to eventually shatter. I lost her. My heart that was once stable and affectionate was filled with rage, not on her, but to myself by not taking action. I blamed myself so much thinking that I was not enough for her to do such a thing, if it were ever true. I even promised myself that I’ll be the best person anyone can look up to, only to shame myself again due to the state I’m at. Broken laptop, broken studies, broken mind, broken heart.
