What about her?

It all started from the previous chapter. Through the course of time, I found someone, alone, doesn't have any close friends from the class, just like how I used to be. Eventually, we talked and I got her into my friend group, the friend group that drove me out in that same alone state. It was great having her in our circle of friends.

Considering my situation in that state, she became one of the most reliable friend I had that time. In all my struggles, she's been the one doing most of our group activities. Although I was thankful, I can't remove of feeling like a burden, oozing from guilt not being able to help. Being an overthinker, I tried to find ways of doing something, maybe something different, and I gave her apples as a form of appreciation hoping that it'll ease my guilt as well.

However, there's this mistake that I did. I didn't know what her intentions are and clearly, she didn't know my intentions either. We had a misunderstanding.

There's this time that I drew someone, uhm the one I've been crushing on. I posted it on my story. Well, having her as one of closest friend, I asked her something like "Is it okay for a couple to have 6-year age gap?" out of curiosity. She played it cool at that time and replied.

After these events, something felt a bit off between us. Only after the end of the semester, she confessed. I didn't know that we had a misunderstanding. She taught that I like her as more than friends only for her to realize that she isn't what I'm affectionate but the one she saw on my drawings. I didn't know that I broke someone's heart accidentally and it made more guilty. This guilt got into me and I began rethinking every actions I had especially that someone's hurting, especially that someone was the one whos been there for me all those hard times. At the end of the semester, we had clarity, a realization that hurts.

Now, moving on this timeline, 2nd Sem, I tried reconsidering my thoughts. Spending the vacation thinking about everything that happened to me, I tried something different. I began trying to like her, as I thought it was the right thing to do for redemption. Besides all my academic struggles, I tried making time to hangout with her. It was hard as my heart tries to fight back, but still, I should return what she deserves. I tried being as close as possible to her, we talked, hangout, even cooked for her.

Btw, she was a member of another choir as well, she even became the president of that choir and I was happy about it knowing that I'm being a shadow president as well. It felt like we're on the same page. We began talking about choirs as well, built trust on each other and eventually I began telling her our choirs plan or other stuffs no-one should here (i guess?)

Later on, our choir had received bad news and critizations from other choir as I hear it from our conductor. Well, too bad our choir groups are in bad terms and always critizing each other. But as soon as I hangout with her, critization became more frequent. I hope I was wrong in assuming that it's because of me hanging out with each other.

Not in the most obvious way but, I then felt being accused as an information leaker in choir. It felt like my own choir is talking about me after all these events and it saddened me. I didn't expect that to happen considering my efforts for the choir. I began doubting myself as well because of this. It seemed like I am a know-it-all "mayabang" person as well. And all these just started after I decided to hangout with her.

This made me doubt her, I really hope that all these delusions was wrong, but I can't shake that kind of feeling. I became a bit distant again rethinking all the things I've said and done.

Eventually in our exams, since we both are members of a choir that will perform, same time as the exam date, we both took the exam early. I had poor marks in the exam, didn't even manage to receive passing marks due to my condition. However, after all these, my intitial friend group asked for the exam details and she gave it to them. Now when they had the exam, it seemed that all my friends got outstanding grades.

I really can't imagine how I turned at this point. I cut all my connections to my friends and became distant to them. This event that seemed to be a betrayal change how I look this people. It erased all the good things that they have in my memory and was replaced with hate.

This made me become a lone-wolf once again. But compared to the prequel timeline, this version is shattered and have nothing left.
