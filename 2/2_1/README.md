# Stress & Comfort

> 2nd Year 1st Semester Reflection

The first wave passed and I've managed to remain standing still. Now, moving to the middle of the war, I’m glad I was able to be ready for what’s about to come, or so I was. I grew, known a few like-minded people, and adopted to a friend group. The start seems so comfortable and I didn’t imagine these words coming from a lone-wolf student before.

Now here I am, same atmosphere, same people, but different story. This part of the journey is when I thought I had improved in my social dynamics. I was able to become reliable towards my friends and build their trust in me along the way. We’ve shared the difficulties we had in our first year experiences, established deeper connection, discovered our similarities with each other and it never felt so good knowing these types of people.

However, challenges in life are inevitable and feeling only joy in life is too good to be true. One thing is my primary weapon in this war, my laptop. Although I’ve experienced crashes from my laptop during my first year, this time it’s different, worse perhaps. By this point of time, it has been crashing much more frequently making assignments take longer to do which became a huge headache. The laptop crashes randomly, giving me a somewhat trauma of BSODs (Blue Screen of Death). This has been my major stress during this time period as I had to redo things when the crash corrupts the file and does not recover from save points. The time where crashes can be felt.

Still, we have to look and find what is in the bad side of things. My laptop crashes and I have to redo my school works most of the time. Yes, it is painful and stressful, but still, it’s just a matter of perspective to continue. I needed to change how looked at it, and see it as just as fate. Redoing most of my tasks somewhat made me practice my skills. Doing the things over and over again sharpened the skills I am trying to learn, and forced me to do things faster. I guess it is a blessing in disguise, or so I thought. Of course, I am from the future just writing all these reflections based on time frame, so there might be a change of perspective in the proceeding parts of this journey.

Anyway, as a conclusion, things might not be as perfect, or perhaps give problems so, it is important to learn how to look at the bright side of things. You don’t have to feel alone as well because you’re not the only one struggling. Talking to friends, sharing thoughts, are good ways to help overcome challenges.
