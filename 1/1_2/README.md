# My Friends are my Power

Unexpected turns have been faced, and now, it's all about continuing the journey.
Courses became harder but still, it felt like the most convenient semester I experienced. This is the time I made not just acquaintances, but long-term friends. It truly made me feel at home, that I belong, shared laughter despite hard and mind breaking studies.

Honestly, I really didn't expect to make friends. I used to be a lone wolf in most of my previous education. I only make a few, maybe three at most, friends back in the days. I always feel like I'm treated differently, never had a school year from elementary to high-school without being bullied because of not being like others. Trusting someone became difficult due to my past experience and only managed to make a few friends. This are all through personal interactions, so how would I even make friends online? It's pandemic era as well and all of my close friends are only the ones I made back in senior high. But still, I was glad that I met people online that shares the same hobbies as mine. All the pressure I had in my rollercoaster first semester eased as I know more about those people, shared struggles with them, worked with them in group projects, and eventually became their friends. Data Structures and Algorithms, Intermediate Programming, yes, the recursion lessons, and every other hard thing we faced, we learned together, helped each other and made it through the first wave.

Even with the difficulties of courses we had, knowing that I'm not alone in the fight made me feel strong. I really couldn't do it without my friends. As Sora's quote from kingdom hearts, yeah, I'm a kingdom hearts fan, _"My Friends Are my Power!"_ and it truly is.

_I hope I can say it once again with the same people I'm referring to here_
